  location constraints starting with cli_prefer or cli_ban is created when there is migration of resources from one node to another. This migration is usually a deviation from the stable configuration and should be restored back in time. A presence of this contraint signifies that the cluster configuration is not in its stable or desired configuration.
  ## Remediation

  ```

  ```
